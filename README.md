Jenbucket
=========

Allows per-branch deployment from bitbucket to a jenkins server.

Receives an incoming POST service request from Bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org)
and connects this through to a jenkins build.

1. Install a php webserver somewhere where bitbucket can access it (e.g. mydomain.com/index.php).
2. Install this script.
3. Point bitbucket to this script instead of using the jenkins plugin.
This is done by doing a post commit action (type POST). Set the following url as your POST url: http://mydomain.com/index.php?project_to_build=JENKINS_PROJECTNAME&branch=JENKINS_BRANCH
4. setup the correct settings:
  * $jenkins_url
  * $jenkins_token inside the index.php file.
5. You're up and running!
